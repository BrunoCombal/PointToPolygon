#Point To Polygon#

A QGis plugin to transform a vector file of points into squares centered on those points.
The square dimension is defined by the padding parameters (the square width is two times the padding value).
If the input file is a vector file of lines or polygons, the centroid of the features will be used to center the polygons.
