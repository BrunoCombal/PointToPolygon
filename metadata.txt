about=Transforms a vector file of points into polygons (squares, rectangles or hexagons) centered on those points. The polygons dimensions are defined by the padding parameters (for a square the width is two times the padding value). If the input file is a vector file of lines or polygons, the centroid of the features will be used as the centre of the output polygons. A rotation can be applied to the output polygons. Optionally, the centroid of the input layer features can be exported.
